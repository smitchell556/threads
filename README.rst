threads
=======

   The easy Python threading module.

``threads`` is a simple module that includes

1. A decorator to easily define threaded functions.
2. Channels

A Simpler Threading Interface
-----------------------------

The ``threaded`` decorator wraps a function and causes that function to
run in a new thread when called. The function returns the
``threading.Thread`` object that the function is running in.

.. code:: python

   from threads import threaded

   @threaded
   def threaded_add(x, y):
       x + y

   threaded_add(1, 2)  # This runs in a new thread!

   def sub(x, y):
       x - y

   threaded_sub = threaded(sub)

   sub(1, 2)           # This runs in the main thread.
   threaded_sub(1, 2)  # This runs in a new thread!

This is a much simpler interface than the traditional way of starting
new threads.

Channels
--------

Channels are heavily inspired by Golangâ€™s Channels. They are thread-safe
and allow threads to easily communicate with each other.

.. code:: python

   from threads import Channel, threaded

   ch = Channel()

   @threaded
   def add(x, y, ch):
       # Instead of returning the value, send it through the channel.
       ch.send(x + y)

   add(1, 2, ch)    # This runs in a new thread.

   print ch.recv()  # recv blocks until a value is sent through the channel.
   # -> 3

If a channel has no value in it, calling ``recv()`` on the channel will
block until a value is sent through the channel. Likewise, if there is
already a value in the channel, calling ``send()`` on the channel will
block until the value is removed from the channel. In both cases, the
channel will release control to allow other threads to run.

.. warning:: The same precautions that need to be taken when using stateful objects
    across threads still applies to objects sent through channels. The
    preferred way to use channels is by passing *data* through them instead
    of stateful objects.
